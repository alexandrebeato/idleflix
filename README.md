IdleFlix is a simple application that prevents your computer from going into idle mode. It does this by simulating user activity at regular intervals, such as pressing a key or moving the mouse. If the computer is left idle for 5 minutes, the mouse automatically moves every second until you have some interaction with the computer again.
